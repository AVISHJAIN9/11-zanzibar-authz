# Project Roadmap: Zanzibar Consistent Authz Engine

Current Status: `UNDER-CONSTRUCTION`

## Phase 1: Core Service & Health Verification (Completed)
- [x] Initial architecture specification and endpoint design.
- [x] Resilient fallback handling and health check probes.
- [x] CI workflows and repository governance integration.

## Phase 2: Performance & Scalability (Planned)
- [ ] Synthetic load benchmarking under high concurrent request volume.
- [ ] Dynamic cache invalidation and distributed session sync.
- [ ] Horizontal worker auto-scaling configuration.

## Phase 3: Observability & Resilience (Planned)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry trace propagation across downstream services.
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export (`/metrics`) for latency percentiles.
- [ ] Automated chaos drill verification under simulated dependency failures.
